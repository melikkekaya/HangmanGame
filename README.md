A short description of what the project is about.

- What does it try to accomplish ?
- What problem does it solve ?
- On what platform is it available ?

- **the main concepts** that need to be there
- and **secondary concepts** that one can do without, but that are useful nonetheless to paint the whole picture.

## Installation

- Run the script `main.py` in your terminal using the command: `python main.py`
### Files

- main.py
This is the main file that runs the game.

### How to Play

- Run the script `main.py` in your terminal using the command: `python main.py`
- The game will randomly select a word from the list of words
- The player will be presented with a series of underscores representing the letters in the word.
- The player must guess a letter by typing it in the terminal.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the underscores.
- If the letter is not in the word, total lives will be deducted one and it will add to error count.
- The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or the lives are completely lost.

## Contributors

If a project was done in a group, but only one person saved the repo, it is useful to link to their GitHub profile for completeness.

### Timeline

When did you work on the project ? Was it yesterday or three years ago? The GitHub repo will certainly mention the dates but it's still more pleasant to read when a human explains that the website showcasing the grey shrimp lovers was made during the summer of 2015 during a hackathon that took place in Miribel.

### Personal situation

What were you doing? During your career as a developer,
you will probably have to work in several companies.
It is helpful to know for what company you are writing a given software or if it is a personal project.
